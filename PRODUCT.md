## Stratlife — Product & Design Philosophy (Locked)

Stratlife is designed as a **calm reflection system**.

It is not a productivity tool.  
It is not a social feed.  
It is not an optimization engine for the self.

This document defines the **constraints** under which Stratlife is built.
These constraints are intentional and protective.

## Core principles

### Orientation > consumption
Screens help users understand where they are  
instead of encouraging endless interaction.

### Reflection > metrics
Numbers, streaks, and scores are secondary to meaning and insight.

### Glimpse > archive
Primary screens show only a small, intentional slice.  
Depth lives on secondary screens.

### Calm > clever
No visual tricks.  
No artificial urgency.  
No engagement-driven mechanics.

### Structure before polish
Screen responsibilities and UX contracts are defined  
before visual refinement.

### Growth without performance anxiety
Stratlife supports noticing what works —  
not optimizing, competing, or comparing.

## Explicit non-goals

- No infinite feeds on the Home screen
- No engagement loops or retention tricks
- No leaderboards, streak pressure, or comparison mechanics
- No content overload on primary screens
- No “optimize your life” framing

- Design decisions are evaluated against **calm and clarity**
- Features are rejected if they blur screen responsibilities
- The product evolves slowly and deliberately
