# Stratlife — MVP Wireframes
#artifact #product #wireframes #mvp

Single source of truth for all MVP screens.

Design contract:
- Calm • Minimal • Reflective
- Orientation > consumption
- One primary action per screen
- Progress is quiet, but visible

Navigation presentation (MVP implementation):
- Destinations use a quiet bottom tab bar: Today | Focus | Journey | Settings
- Flows open as modals: Capture, Life Check
