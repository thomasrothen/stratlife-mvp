## Stratlife — Product & Design Philosophy (Locked)

Stratlife is designed as a **calm reflection system**.

It is not a productivity tool.  
It is not a social feed.  
It is not an optimization engine for the self.

This document defines the **constraints** under which Stratlife is built.  
These constraints are intentional, protective, and slow-changing.

---

## Core principles

### Orientation > consumption
Screens exist to help users understand **where they are**,  
not to keep them interacting.

If a screen encourages scrolling by default, it is misdesigned.

---

### Reflection > metrics
Numbers, streaks, scores, and rankings are secondary.

Meaning is discovered through:
- noticing patterns
- rereading experiences
- observing change over time

Not through performance anxiety.

---

### Glimpse > archive
Primary screens show only a small, intentional slice.  
Depth lives on secondary screens.

Home is a glance, not a timeline.

---

### Calm > clever
No visual tricks.  
No artificial urgency.  
No engagement-driven mechanics.

If a feature requires persuasion, it does not belong.

---

### Structure before polish
Screen responsibilities and UX contracts are defined  
before visual refinement.

---

### Growth without performance anxiety
Stratlife supports noticing what works —  
not optimizing, competing, or comparing.

---

## MVP constraints (Locked)

- One user (self)
- Private by default
- No social graph
- No feed
- No engagement loops

---

## UI constraints (Locked)

- Clear typography
- Neutral surfaces
- Soft borders
- Gentle spacing rhythm
- Minimal animations

---

## Interaction constraints (Locked)

- One primary action per screen
- Every flow ends cleanly
- No endless scroll as default behavior

---

## What Stratlife is (and is not)

Stratlife is:
- a reflection OS
- a memory system
- a gentle direction tool

Stratlife is not:
- a habit tracker
- a productivity dashboard
- a social performance platform

---

## Open Decisions (Track, decide later)

- **Bottom tab bar behavior:** always visible vs auto-hide on scroll.
- **Destination set:** whether Settings remains a tab long-term.
- **Focus placement:** tab vs short modal flow.
