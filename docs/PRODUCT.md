## Stratlife — Product & Design Philosophy (Locked)

Stratlife is designed as a **calm reflection system**.

It is not a productivity tool.  
It is not a social feed.  
It is not an optimization engine for the self.

This document defines the **constraints** under which Stratlife is built.  
These constraints are intentional, protective, and slow-changing.

---

## Core principles

### Orientation > consumption
Screens exist to help users understand **where they are**,  
not to keep them interacting.

If a screen encourages scrolling by default, it is misdesigned.

---

### Reflection > metrics
Numbers, streaks, scores, and rankings are secondary.

Meaning is discovered through:
- noticing patterns
- rereading experiences
- observing change over time

Not through performance indicators.

---

### Glimpse > archive
Primary screens show **only a small, intentional slice**.

Depth, history, and completeness live on **secondary screens**  
that are entered deliberately.

---

### Calm > clever
No visual tricks.  
No artificial urgency.  
No engagement-driven mechanics.

The interface should feel:
- neutral
- respectful
- emotionally safe

---

### Structure before polish
Screen responsibilities and UX contracts are defined  
**before** visual refinement or animation.

Polish must never compensate for unclear structure.

---

### Growth without performance anxiety
Stratlife supports **noticing what works**  
without turning life into a system to be optimized.

There is no competition — not even with your past self.

---

## Explicit non-goals (Hard constraints)

- No infinite feeds on the Home screen
- No engagement loops or retention tricks
- No leaderboards, streak pressure, or social comparison
- No content overload on primary screens
- No “optimize your life” or “be better” framing
- No guilt-driven reminders or nudging

If a feature needs pressure to work, it does not belong.

---

## Screen responsibility map (UX contracts)

Each screen answers **one primary question only**.  
If a screen tries to do more, it is wrong.

---

### Home (Index)
**Primary question:** *Where am I right now?*  
**Purpose:** Orientation & awareness

- Weekly rhythm (time context)
- Latest **3 wins only** (intentional glimpse)
- Summary-only cards
- No rich media
- No full notes
- No performance indicators
- Leads outward to deeper screens

Home must feel:
- light
- quiet
- grounding

If Home becomes interesting, it’s broken.

---

### History / Archive
**Primary question:** *What does my trajectory look like?*  
**Purpose:** Memory & pattern recognition

- Full list of wins
- Time-based grouping (weeks first)
- Normal scrolling
- Calm, neutral presentation
- Search & filters later

History is not a feed — it is a logbook.

---

### Win Detail
**Primary question:** *What actually happened?*  
**Purpose:** Reflection & meaning

- Full note
- Media preview (photos / videos later)
- Editing and extension
- No analytics
- No scoring
- No “engagement” elements

This is a private reflection space, not a performance view.

---

### Weekly Reflection
**Primary question:** *What did this week mean?*  
**Purpose:** Synthesis & understanding

- Weekly prompts
- Light pattern recognition
- Optional participation
- No daily pressure
- No required completion

---

### Pattern / Insight View (Later)
**Primary question:** *What tends to work over time?*  
**Purpose:** Insight without judgment

- Recurring themes
- Long-term trends
- Observational, not prescriptive
- Optional, never default

---

## Development stance

- Every feature is evaluated against **calm and clarity**
- Features are rejected if they blur screen responsibilities
- The product evolves **slowly and deliberately**
- Silence, absence, and emptiness are valid states

Stratlife is not built to extract attention.  
It is built to **hold experience gently**.
