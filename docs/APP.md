App Store Description (Long)

Most growth happens quietly.

We reflect, learn, improve — often alone.
Progress is real, but invisible.
Direction gets blurry.

Stratlife exists to change that.

⸻

Understand where you stand

With the Life Check, you pause and see how your life really feels — across the areas that matter.

⸻

Choose what matters now

The Focus Wall helps you decide where to place your attention — not more goals, but meaningful focus.

⸻

Make progress visible

Capture moments and achievements — even small ones.
Over time, they become proof of growth.

⸻

Grow with purpose

Some moments are just for you.
Others might one day inspire someone else.

Stratlife gently turns personal growth into shared impact — when you’re ready.

⸻
